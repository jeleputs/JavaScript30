    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    let name = 'ric';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'ricardo';
    console.log(name, name2);

    //cuando nosotros asignamos primitivos, se pasan por valor.

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    //C, C++ &team = players;

    console.log(team, players);

    const team2 = players.slice();

    const team6 = players.map(player => player);

    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      address: {
        street: 'fake street',
        number: 143
      }
    };

    console.clear();

    //const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    //console.log(person, person2);


    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person);

    console.log(person3);

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
